In this repository, I have added some of my mini-projects in AI-ML.
Each mini-project is in a separate folder containing the necessary data files and code files (jupyter notebooks). Folder names same as the project names.

### Mini-Projects:
1. **Stock Prediction**: 
    - This project uses XGBoost to predict stock prices.
    - The dataset contains intraday stock prices of MSFT (15 min intervals). Historical data of most recent 5000 timestamps.
    - I did EDA, feature engineering (lag features, moving averages) and simulation of a realistic trading strategy based on the model predictions.
